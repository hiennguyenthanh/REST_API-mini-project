# REST_API-mini-project (Study)

>> npm i (to  install all needed packages used for this project)

Description: 
- As in REST API server, requests are handled isolately => no authentication using sessions. Alternatively, I use JWTs to authenticate.

- If not authenticated, Client can: 
    + Signup
    + Login
    
- If authenticated, Client can: 
    + Get all posts
    + Get a post by id
    + Create a post
    + Update a post (authorized)
    + Delete a post (authorized)
    
    + Get user status 
    + Update user status (authorized)
